# Intelligent Resume Shortlisting

This project focuses on intelligent resume shortlisting by combining both resume text and structured profile data. A deep learning model was developed, where features from text and tabular inputs were fused to predict job category probabilities.

The system processes resumes in overlapping chunks using a frozen BERT encoder and structured fields using field-wise embeddings, enabling more accurate and context-aware shortlisting decisions.

**Achieved 97.77% accuracy** on the resume dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the fusion-based approach.
